[b]Description:[/b]
The Swipe LR mod allows users to swipe left & right on an SMF forum when using a touchscreen enabled device.

Swiping navigates to the next or previous topic in the board.  It behaves as if you had clicked on the "Previous Topic" or "Next Topic" links at the top of the page.  These links are not available on a smartphone in responsive mode, so this mod enables that navigation via swiping.

[b]Limitations:[/b]
 - Javascript must be enabled.
 - Left & right navigates among topics only, it does not navigate among admin menu tabs, etc.
 - This mod may not work if a custom theme has redefined, reused, or restructured the "nextlinks" class.
